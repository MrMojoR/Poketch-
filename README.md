===============

Pokétch Digital is a Pebble watchface designed to emulate the digital watchface used on the Pokétch watch in Pokémon Diamond/Pearl/Platinum.

Currently at V1.0, it displays similarly to the Poketch digital watchface in Pokémon Platinum with the cute Pikachu at the bottom. Future versions will have an option of switching the Pikachu on/off in the Pebble app Settings as well as other functionality such as colour inversion.
