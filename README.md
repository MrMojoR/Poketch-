Pokétch Digital

Pokétch Digital is a Pebble watchface designed to emulate the digital watchface used on the Pokétch watch in Pokémon Diamond/Pearl/Platinum.

Currently at V1.0, it displays similarly to the Poketch digital watchface in Pokémon Diamond & Pearl.

Planned Features:

Config Settings: Toggle Pikachu, Flashing Separaters, Colour Inversion, Vibrate on Hour.

Possible Features:

Setting that makes Pikachu release static from his cheeks while causing the Pebble to vibrate (sort of similar to Pokémon Pinball).
